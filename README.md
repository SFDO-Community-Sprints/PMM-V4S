### Project Vision (Please make this your first task as a team)

Currently organizations using PMM & V4S have data data living in both products. This solution is aimed at cleanly syncing the data across the two product. 
Data entry is minimized (eg donâ€™t need to enter everything twice once in PMM, once in V4S) 

### Project Resources (It's ok if you'd prefer to type all the things in Google docs, Quip, or your word processor of choice, just please make sure you include links to your work here in Github. We need a source of truth, and for now that's here in GitHub.)

**Important**: If you have specific asks to help move this project forward we would recommend that you list them here, but also create separate Issues for each and add the label of "help wanted". This is a well-worn best practice for projects living in GitHub.
