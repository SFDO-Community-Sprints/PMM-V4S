### Project Vision (Please make this your first task as a team)

Currently organizations using PMM & V4S have data data living in both products. This solution is aimed at cleanly syncing the data across the two product. 
Data entry is minimized (eg donâ€™t need to enter everything twice once in PMM, once in V4S) 


### Project Team Accomplishments

September Virtual Sprint 2020: Draft documentation started detailing various use case ideas. When to use PMM vs V4S, PMM only solutions, and possible hybrid model solution. Comparison chart for PMM and V4S (starting on page 4)


### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)

Possible items to explore include the various connections after new PMM Winter release in addition to how to migrate data from V4S to PMM. Looking at creating a recipe doc similar to (https://powerofus.force.com/s/article/NPSP-Custom-Rllps-Recipes).

With the PMM winter release we are looking at connecting Service Sessions object with a V4S object.
