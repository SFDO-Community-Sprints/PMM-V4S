## Welcome to PMM Meets V4S Recipe Docs

The goal for a hybrid solution is to allow data to live in both products without needing to do duplicate information entries. Not sure how to decide if you need PMM, V4S or Hybrid as your solution? Head over to our [wiki](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/PMM-V4S/wiki/Compare-PMM,-V4S-and-Hybrid) to compare the 2 products. 


### Why do I need a hybrid solution?
Nonprofits come in all shapes and sizes. For some organizations, they run into a use case where they need the _ability to track detailed program engagements, but also leverage all the cool volunteer search, sign-up functionalities that V4S enables out of the box_ **Please review this value prop**. To take the best of both worlds, a hybrid solution allows organizations be able to track programs at the granularity and manage volunters.
